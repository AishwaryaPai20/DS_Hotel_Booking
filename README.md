# Hotel_Booking

### About Dataset

This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and 31st of August 2017, including booking that effectively arrived and booking that were canceled.
Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining hotel or costumer identification were deleted.
Four Columns, 'name', 'email', 'phone number' and 'credit_card' have been artificially created and added to the dataset.

### Acknowledgements

The data is originally from the article Hotel Booking Demand Datasets, written by Nuno Antonio, Ana Almeida, and Luis Nunes for Data in Brief, Volume 22, February 2019.

### Questions 

1. What are the variables that affect the hotel reservation cancellation ?
2. How can we make hotel reservation cancellation better?

### Hypothesis from dataset

1. More cancellation occurs when prices are higher
2. Reservation rates are inversely proportional to the cancellation rates

### Suggestions

1. Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.

2. As the ratio of the cancellation and not cancellation of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than the city hotels. So the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or on holidays.

3. In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as the cancellation is the highest in this month.

4. They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in portugal to reduce the cancellationÂ rate.
